Logan Wilcox
	- Hey guys. So I would say my strengths are definitley styling with CSS and making sure everythign with the CSS / HTML lines up. I definitley feel like I have a strength with the styling part of things. As for JavaScript, I would say I am a little less adept with it.. Unlike CSS and HTML, I feel like JavaScript takes more tampering / trial and error for me. It's not that I don't understand it or can't write good JavaScript, I am just not as familiar with it and the syntax can be confusing at times. I am also good at managing a project. I feel comfortable throwing out any ideas I have and working with everyone on how to best implement them. Looking forward to woking with you guys.
Randy Mai
	- What's up guys. So basically I'm on the same boat as Logan here, where I can't do much javascript. Another thing is that, I have trouble using CSS grid but I can use flexbox perfectly fine. So yeah, I'm pretty flexible and willing to try to tackle challenging ideas for the website you guys might have.
Jarron Bailey
	- Hey, I feel like I'm pretty proficient in all three areas(HTML,CSS,JavaScript). I have not used CSS grid, but it should not be that hard to implement if you guys want it. Im also good at troubleshooting and tackling problems.
Zayaan Haider 
  - Hey Guys. I'm sort of the opposite of you guys in that I'm great with html, and okay with javascript, but really bad with css. So I think it should be pretty good to use our strengths together to make this group project work out. I'm a pretty good team player so hopefully it will go smooth. Looking forward to working with all of you guys.
