Logan Wilcox - Hey guys. So I would say my strengths are definitley styling with CSS and making sure everythign with the CSS / HTML lines up. I definitley feel like I have a strength with the
	       styling part of things. As for JavaScript, I would say I am a little less adept with it.. Unlike CSS and HTML, I feel like JavaScript takes more tampering / trial and error for me.
	       It's not that I don't understand it or can't write good JavaScript, I am just not as familiar with it and the syntax can be confusing at times. I am also good at managing a project.
	       I feel comfortable throwing out any ideas I have and working with everyone on how to best implement them. Looking forward to woking with you guys.
Randy Mai - What's up guys. So basically I'm on the same boat as Logan here, where I can't do much javascript. Another thing is that, I have trouble using CSS grid but I can use flexbox perfectly fine. So yeah, I'm pretty flexible and willing to try to tackle challenging ideas for the website you guys might have.
